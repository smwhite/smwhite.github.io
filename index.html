									<h2>About Me</h2>
									<p>I am Shawn White(not the snowboarder) and I am currently an IT Technician for Eldorado Resorts Inc. I gratuated from UNR in 2016
										with a bachelor's degree in computer science and engineering. I love working with computers and am fascinated by technology in 
										general. Below you can find a copy of my resume but because this is being posted on a public site my address, phone number, and 
										email will be left out. If you are someone who has randomly stumbled upon this page and wish to contact me please use the "Contact Me"
										form below.</p>

							<h2>Projects</h2>
							<p>Here is an overview of projects I've worked on in the past or am currently working on. This section will be pretty light currently as most
								projects I've worked on I don't have code or a working version of it and others should never be viewed by anyone because of how bad or unfinished
								they are.</p>

							<p>If you are interested in contacting me feel free to use the form below. Fair warning though this web page isn't meant to be viewed by random
								people so if you are viewing this page I assume you already have my contact information. That being said the form below is more of a proof of
								concept and the email it goes to will not be regularly monitored.</p>
