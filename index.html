										with a bachelor's degree in computer science and engineering. I love working with computers and am fascinated by technology in 
										general. Below you can find a copy of my resume but because this is being posted on a public site my address, phone number, and 
										email will be left out. If you are someone who has randomly stumbled upon this page and wish to contact me please use the "Contact Me"

							<h2>Projects</h2>
							<p id="p3">Here is an overview of projects I've worked on in the past or am currently working on. This section will be pretty light currently as most
								projects I've worked on I don't have code or a working version of it and others should never be viewed by anyone because of how bad or unfinished
								they are. I am currently still building seperate webpages for these so for the time being the links below will just link to github repositories</p>
							<div id="ProjectsTableSection">
								<a class="Project" href="https://github.com/smwhite/smwhite.github.io"><div id="ProjectOne">
									<h4>This Website</h4>
									<p class="ProjectText">Shawnwhite.xyz is a website for me to practice and show of my web dev skills. It is currently hosted using github pages and
										is only compatible with google chrome on a PC. I will work on supporting other browsers and mobile over time.</p>
								</div></a>
								<a class="Project" href="https://github.com/smwhite/Old-Graphics-Code"><div id="ProjectTwo">
									<h4>Super Marble Blast Not so Ultra</h4>
									<p class="ProjectText">A game inspired by Super Marble Blast Ultra that isn't quite as good. Coded in C++ it uses OpenGL and the Bullet physic engine. 
										This currently links to an entire class worth of projects it is in the folder P11. The original read me for the project seems to be missing, I will
										work on moving the whole project to it's own folder and laying out the requirements to run it as soon as I get a chance.</p>
